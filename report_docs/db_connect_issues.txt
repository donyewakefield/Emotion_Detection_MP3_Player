db_connect - Issues
* the password may need to be hashed in some way for security reasons
* label needs to be generalized to accept any label from the AI model
* function should be made that handles this whole process of selecting and fetching info and song itself 
* there is no need for aliases in the query on line 37
* make sure there is a way to loop this process of selecting and fetching info and song itself instead of program terminating each time a song is over
* Optimize code if possible
